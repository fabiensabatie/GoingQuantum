# Quantum Corewar

## Dependencies :

The quantum corewar (more of a quantum tic-tac-toe), works using qiskit only, and can run on a real quantum computer thanks to the IBM Q Experience framework : Qiskit.
This project is still under active development and more features will be added to it soon.
The objective is to allow people to plug in a list of gate instructions they want to apply in
order to automate the gates applications process. In other words, soon the program will take
as argument a quantum circuit, that will be applied to the tic-tac-to grid. 

Use python 3 to execute main.py :

```
python3 main.py
```
You can also use the option "-s" to run it on a simulator directly.

# Quantum Computing Scripts

## Dependencies :

These scripts use the QisKit and QisKit ACQUA python frameworks, install using :

```
pip install qiskit qiskit-acqua
```

Use python 3 to execute the scripts :

```
python3 emoticon.py
```
